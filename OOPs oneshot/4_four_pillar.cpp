/* 
The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are fundamental concepts that form the basis of OOP languages like C++, Java, and Python. These pillars help in designing and structuring software in a way that promotes code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. The four pillars are:

1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and attributes.

Benefits:
i. Protects the internal state of an object.
ii. Provides a controlled interface for accessing and modifying object data.


2. Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It allows a programmer to focus on interacting with the object rather than understanding its internal workings.

Benefits:
i. Reduces complexity by hiding unnecessary details.
ii. Improves code readability and usability.


3. Inheritance
Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (the derived or child class) can inherit the attributes and methods of another class (the base or parent class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

Benefits:
i. Allows for code reuse and organization.
ii. Facilitates polymorphism and dynamic method resolution.


4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, and it enables a single interface to be used for different underlying forms (data types). It allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon.

Types of Polymorphism:
i. Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading and operator overloading).
ii. Run-time polymorphism (method overriding using inheritance and virtual functions).
